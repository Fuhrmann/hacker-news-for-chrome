## Hacker News Chrome Extension  


This is an extension for Google Chrome that displays the latest links from Y Combinator's [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com). It also features a link for submitting the url of the current tab and, optionally, desktop notifications of the current #1 HN story.


#### Possible Future Updates:
* Configurable # of stories to show
* Ability to show the newest stories instead of the most popular
* Thinking about removing notifications since this can be done in other ways
